        <h3 id="Malware">Malware</h3>			    
		  <h2><strong>MALWARE</strong></h2>
		       <div id="malware"><p>Malware, <strong>malicious software</strong>, is a blanket term for viruses, worms, trojans and other harmful computer programs hackers use to wreak destruction and gain access to sensitive information. As Microsoft puts it, "is any software designed to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network". In other words, software is identified as malware based on its intended use, rather than a particular technique or technology used to build it.<p/></div>
			   <div id="virus-vs-malware"><p>*what is the difference between malware and a virus? A virus is a type of malware, so all viruses are malware.<p/></div>
			   <img src="https://previews.123rf.com/images/scyther5/scyther51601/scyther5160100095/51156177-hacker-using-laptop-hacking-the-internet-.jpg" width="300" length="400">
			   <div id="types-malware"><p>TYPES OF MALWARE</p></div>
			      <p>There are a number of different ways of categorizing malware; the first is by how the malicious software spreads:</p>
				  <ul>
				      <li>A <strong>WORM</strong> is a standalone piece of malicious software that reproduces itself and spreads from computer to computer.</li>
					  <img src="https://blog.emsisoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/malware-worms-blog-banner.png" width="300" length="400">
					  <li>A <strong>VIRUS</strong> is a piece of computer code that inserts itself in the code of another standalone program, then, forces that program to take malicious action and spread itself.</li>

					  <li>A  <strong>TROJAN</strong>  is a program that cannot reproduce itself but seems as something the user wants and tricks them into activating it so it can do its damage and spread.</li>
					  <img src="https://mike.miracomosehace.com/uploads/images/content/virus_14709.png" width="300" length="400">
				  </ul>
			   <div id="manually-malware"><p>*Malware can also be installed on a computer "manually" by the attackers themselves.</p></div>
               <div id="spyware"><p>-Another way to categorize malware is by what it does once it has successfully infected its victim's computers:<br> <strong>Spyware</strong> is a malware used for the purpose of secretly gathering data on an unsuspecting user. In essence, it spies on your behavior as you use your computer, and on the data you send and receive, usually with the purpose of sending that information to a third party. A keylogger is a specific kind of spyware that records all the keystrokes a user makes (great for stealing passwords).</p></div>

        <h3 id="Software and Hardware to protect Networks">Software and Hardware to protect Networks</h3>
		   <div id="software-hardware"><p><strong>SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE TO PROTECT NETWORKS</strong></p></div>
		   <p>Hardware components include servers and devices that perform an array of security operations within a network. Hardware components can be set up in two ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Out of the path of network traffic (“out-of-line”):</strong> Operating as a separate entity from network traffic, out-of-line security appliances are tasked with monitoring traffic and raising alerts when they detect malicious data.</li>
				<li><strong>In the path of network traffic (“in-line”):</strong> A more popular option of the two, in-line hardware appliances are tasked with directly blocking data packets the moment they run into potential threats.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Security software components are installed on devices across the network, providing added detection capabilities and threat remediation. The far most common form of software network security components are antivirus applications.</p>
			<div id="types-net-sec"><p><strong>Some Types of Network Security,Tools and Methods</strong></p></div>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Access Control & Authentication:</strong> protect networks and data by validating user credentials and ensuring that those users are only permitted to access the data that is necessary for their role.</li>
				<img src="https://www.logsign.com/uploads/authorization_and_authentication_0e0a962e49.png" width="300" length="400">
				<li><strong>Anti-Virus & Anti-Malware:</strong> protect networks from malicious software that is used by threat actors to create a backdoor that they can use to further infiltrate the network.</li>
				<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D0TloxRUpns/maxresdefault.jpg" width="300" length="400">
				<li><strong>Application Security:</strong> ensures that the software used throughout the network is secure. Application security is ensured by limiting the amount of software that is used, ensuring that software is kept up-to-date with the latest security patches</li>
				<img src="https://lvivity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/wa_secure.jpg" width="300" length="400">
				<li><strong>Firewalls:</strong> hardware appliances and software programs that act as a barrier between incoming traffic and the network. The firewall compares data packets that are sent over the network to predefined policies and rules that indicate whether or not the data should be permitted into the network.</li>

           <div id="net-protocols"><p><strong>NETWORK PROTOCOLS</strong></p></div>
	       <div id="protocols"><p>Network protocols are a set of rules, conventions, and data structures that dictate how devices exchange data across networks.</p></div>
	       <div id="H-IPv6"><p><strong>IPv6: Internet Protocol version 6</strong></p></div>
		   <div id="IPv6"><p>IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol, a network layer protocol that possesses addressing and control information for enabling packets to be routed in the network. It increases the IP address size from 32 bits to 128 bits to support more levels of addressing.</p></div>

           <div id="H-HTTPS"><p><strong>HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure</strong></p></div>
		   <div id="HTTPS"><p>HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. This communication protocol combines HTTP and SSL / TS protocols so that data transmission between client and web server is secure. For this, it uses an encrypted connection that makes the information practically indecipherable to a third party. At first it was a protocol oriented only towards ecommerce or online banking, but it is becoming a standard on the Internet. Users seek security when browsing the Internet and an HTTP protocol is insufficient.</p></div></div>

           <div id="H-SSL"><p><strong>SSL: Secure Sockets Layer</strong></p></div>
		   <div id="SSL"><p>Is an encryption-based Internet security protocol. It was first developed by Netscape in 1995 for the purpose of ensuring privacy, authentication, and data integrity in Internet communications. SSL is the predecessor to the modern TLS encryption used today. A website that implements SSL/TLS has "HTTPS" in its URL instead of "HTTP."</p></div>

          <div id="DC-CA"><p><strong>DIGITAL CERTIFICATES AND CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES</strong></p></div>
		  <div id="certificates"><p>Digital certificates are issued by trusted parties, called certificate authorities, to verify the identity of an entity, such as a client or server.<br>The digital certificate serves two purposes: it verifies the owner's identity and it makes the owner's public key available.<br>For a digital certificate to be entirely trustworthy, the owner of the digital certificate must have carefully protected their private key, for example, by encrypting it on their computer's hard drive.<br>You can use self-signed digital certificates for testing purposes. A self-signed digital certificate contains your distinguished name, your public key, and your signature.</p></div>
