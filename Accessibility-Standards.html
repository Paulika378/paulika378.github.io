	  <h1><strong>Accessibility-Standars</strong></h1>
	      <div id="info"><p>The Web Accessibility Initiative, project by the World Wide Web Consortium, published the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. Then, the WAI released the WCAG 2.0. WCAG 2.0 aims to be up to date and more technology neutral. Though web designers can choose either standard to follow, the WCAG 2.0 have been widely accepted as the definitive guidelines on how to create accessible websites.</p></div>

	      <div id="WHAT-IS"><p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web. Founded in 1994 and currently led by Tim Berners-Lee, the consortium is made up of member organizations that maintain full-time staff working together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web. W3C standards define an Open Web Platform for application development that has the unprecedented potential to enable developers to build rich interactive experiences, powered by vast data stores, that are available on any device.W3C develops these technical specifications and guidelines through a process designed to maximize consensus about the content of a technical report, to ensure high technical and editorial quality, and to earn endorsement by W3C and the broader community.</p></div>
