        <h1>Difference between <strong>ACTIVE</strong> and <strong>PASSIVE</strong> security <strong>THREATS</strong> </h1>
    <body>

<p>The security attacks can be classified into two types that are active and passive attacks where the attacker gains illegal<br>
	acces to the system's resources.<br>

<p>The major difference between active and passive attacks is that in active attacks the attacker<br>
 <strong>intercepts the connection</strong> and <strong>modifies the information</strong>.<br>
 Whereas, in a passive attack, the attacker intercepts the transit information with the intention of <br>
 <strong>reading and analyzing</strong> the information <strong>NOT</strong> for altering it.<br>
 Also, active threats always causes damage to the system but passive do not cause any harm.<br>
 In addition, in an active attack, the victim <strong>gets informed </strong> about it but in the other,<br>
 is <strong>unaware</strong> of it.<br>
