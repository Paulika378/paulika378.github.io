			  <li>On our computer, we need a DNA card reader program downloaded.</li>
			  <li>We go to Google, to open the electronic office of the entity to which we have to process a file.</li>
			  <li>Once the interested electronic office has been opened and the DNI reader connected by USB to the computer, we enter our DNA in the reader.</li>
			  <li>We begin the steps to enter the chosen electronic office, we will be asked to give us several options(occasional password or digital certificate...).</li>
			  <li>We choose the electronic DNI option. Then, it asks us for the password that we put when registering our ID in the dispensing machines of the National Police Station.</li>
			  <li>Once you have entered the password and give ok, we enter the electronic office of the entity with all data (name, surname, DNA, address).</li>
			  <li>Follow the steps required by the entity to process a file.</li>
			  <li>At the end of the process, you will be ask to sign the document digitally.</li>
			  <li>It will give you the options to verify the entire process and keep a copy of what was processed.</li>
		  </ol>
